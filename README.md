This file contains:
- UART mode for the X, Y, and Z axes.
- Power failure recovery.
- 9-point manual bed leveling per axis.
- Filament runout sensor.
- Measurements for the XYZ axes at their maximum travel speeds.
- Adjusted power consumption from 12V to 24V, which is the power supply's operating speed.
- Stealchop disabled.
- XYZ axes microsteps from 16 to 32 (Moves twice as fast if left at their default value).
- Screen rotated 270Â° and adjusted to portrait mode.
- Background color changed to "BLACK_MARLIN".
